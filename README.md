# Freebsd-Mac-desktop-setup-script
A script to make FreeBSD more like MacOS




SETTING UP THE SCRIPT:

First, Go to https://mega.nz/file/qHJHQKQI#0IXj35tBlmKodh0usbJ3qBitS_B-T4laDd0FNalA6Tk and download the setup.sh file. Then, type in "sh setup.sh" and follow the on screen instructions for setting up the script. Once the script finishes, It will either succeed and install your desktop or fail and not work. If all goes well you will now have a MacOS like GUI on FreeBSD!
